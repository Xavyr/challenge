# Set Up Guide (Local Dev)
- git clone `https://github.com/Be-Water-Development/local-dev-docker-postgres` in order to have a seperate docker container running Postgres
- From within root, run `docker compose up` -- don't worry about seeding anything

# Set Up Guide (Challenge App)
- git clone this repo
- run `npm i` from root dir
- run `npx prisma migrate dev` to apply the migration stack to the up and runnning postgres db
- run `npm start` to turn the app on

# Usage 
Using postman or the like hit the POST route with a payload like this:
{
    "email": "avg@gmail.com",
    "name": "avg",
    "age": 33,
    "carModel": "Tundra",
    "yearsOfDrivingExperience": 8
}

This will return a userId -- hit the GET route like this: `localhost:3001/api/quotes/best-three?userId=PLANT_USER_ID`

## Node.js Backend Challenge: Insurance Policy Quote Integration

### Scenario:
You work for CaliSafe Insurance, a fictitious insurance company in California. Your task is to create a backend service that integrates with an external insurance dispatcher API, fetches quotes based on user input, and returns the best three quotes to the front-end.

### Requirements:

#### Setup:
Initialize a new Node.js project using TypeScript.
Set up a PostgreSQL database using your preferred ORM (e.g., TypeORM, Sequelize).

#### API Endpoints:
`/api/quotes`: POST request that takes user details (name, age, car model, years of driving experience) and fetches insurance quotes.
`/api/quotes/best-three`: GET request that retrieves the best three quotes (lowest price) from the previously fetched quotes.

#### Integration:
Integrate with a mocked insurance dispatcher API. Use tools like json-server or MirageJS to mock the external API.

#### Database:
Store all fetched quotes in the PostgreSQL database with relevant user details.

#### Error Handling:
Properly handle potential errors like invalid user input, API failures, etc.

#### Documentation:
Provide a brief README detailing how to set up and run the project.

#### Bonus (not required, but good to have):
- Implement caching to speed up repeated requests.
- Include unit and integration tests.
- Implement a rate-limiting mechanism to avoid overloading the mocked dispatcher API.
- Containerize the application using Docker.
- Use an AWS service, like AWS Lambda, to showcase a serverless deployment.

#### Evaluation Points (Total: 100 points):

- Project Setup (20 points)
- Proper TypeScript setup: 10 points.
- PostgreSQL and ORM setup: 10 points.
- API Endpoints (25 points)
- Correct implementation of /api/quotes: 15 points.

- Successful integration with the mocked API: 10 points.
- Proper data storage and retrieval with PostgreSQL: 15 points.
- Error Handling (10 points)
- Comprehensive error handling: 10 points.
- Documentation (10 points)
- Clear and concise README: 10 points.

#### Bonus Points (up to 10 points each)
- Caching: 5 points.
- Testing: 5 points.
- Rate limiting: 5 points.
- Docker: 5 points.
- Serverless deployment with AWS: 10 points.
